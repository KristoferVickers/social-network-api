## Description:

I for the life of me cannot get the routes to populate on insomina the app runs and what not but the routes will not populate. I will be schedualing a tutoring session this week coming up to get this project fully operational. I used alot of code from the mini project. Nothing Im doing is seeming to work to fix the route issue. I am turing it in as is for now. 

## Technology:

Project is created with:

- Javascript
- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB
- Mongoose

## User Story

```md

```
